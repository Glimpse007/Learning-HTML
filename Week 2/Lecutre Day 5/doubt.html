                        <p>
                            Uttarkahnd is state of god where sun comes to touch the feet of god (The Lord Krishna). It was found on the 9th Nvember 2000 as the 27th state of India, when it was carved out of the Uttar Pradesh. Uttarakhand is spiritual place where you can feel the presence of god and pure nature and pure hearts of pure peoples. at first Uttarakhand was the part of Uttar Pradeh.
                            Uttarakhand is unique in itself. 
                            Uttarakhand, a state in northern India crossed by the Himalayas, is known for its Hindu pilgrimage sites. Rishikesh, a major centre for yoga study, was made famous by the Beatles’ 1968 visit. The city hosts the evening Ganga Aarti, a spiritual gathering on the sacred Ganges River.
                        Uttarkashi, Chamoli and Pithoragarh districts of Uttarakhand share International boundary in the NW with China. In the east, the districts of Pithoragarh, Champawat and Udham Singh Nagar also share International boundary with Nepal. Uttarkashi and Dehradun share inter-state boundaries with Himachal Pradesh in the north-west, while Dehradun, Haridwar, part of Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar touches the boundary of Uttar Pradesh in the south.
                    The Garhwal Himalayas along with Kumaon and a part of Himachal Pradesh has unique characteristics as it has Tibet in the north, Upper Gangetic Plain in the south and Eastern Himalayan provinces in the east. Physiographically, Uttarakhand represents a cross-section of the Himalaya on the basis of its evolutionary history, namely the Trans-Himalaya, Greater Himalaya or Himadri, Lesser Himalaya, Shiwalik Ranges, foothills & Terai and the Plains of Dehradun, Haridwar and Udham Singh nagar.
                    The state is represented by biographic zone 2B Western Himalaya and 7B Shiwaliks consisting of Kumaon and Garhwal regions. Total geographical area of the state (53,483 sq.km) is 1.6 % of the total geographical area of the Country, out of which 46,035 sq.km is hilly. The major wealth of the state is its forests with very rich biodiversity. The state ranks sixth among the other states in terms of percentage of recorded forest area. The state has thus varied terrain, major portion of which is mountainous with unique ecological diversity consisting of high alpine areas to the Sub-tropical and Tropical regions. Total Forest cover area in the state is 3.47 million ha constituting 71% of the State’s Geographical area. The forest diversity of the state comprises of Tropical Moist Forest (500-1000m) which is Terai and Bhabar belt of Sub Himalayan Tract, Sub-Tropical Pine Forest (1000-2000m), Himalayan Moist Temperate Forest (2000-3000m), Sub-Alpine Forests (3400-4000m) and Alpine Forests  4000-5000m). Physiographically, the state can be divided into three zones namely, the Himalaya, The Shiwalik and the Tarai Region. The state has a temperate climate except in plain areas where the climate is tropical. The average annual rainfall is 1550 mm.
                    Enormous floristic and vegetation diversity marks the upper limit of vegetation, with variety of orchids, horticulture and economic plants, including Bamboo, wild germplasm of some cultivated species. By virtue of its extensive geographical stretch, varied terrain and climate the Himalayan Mountain Ranges in Uttarakhand are bestowed with a series of wetlands. Important perennial rivers are Ganga, Yamuna, Bhagirathi, Alaknanda, Ramganga, Nayar, Kosi, Saryu, Sharda and their tributaries. These wetlands, which are some of the most productive and endangered ecosystems, exhibit tremendous faunal diversity from Protozoa to Mammalia. They are roosting & breeding grounds and shelters for migratory and resident birds during various times of the year. 

With abounding diversity on all accounts, the biodiversity of the State is bound to be rich. After the creation of Uttarakhand, as many as 3748 faunal species were inventoried and documented which included 451 species and sub-species, two new Taxa, 22 constitute a first record for India. Ten species occurring in the state are endemic to India. The faunal species included 1060 species of vertebrates, 2020 species of Insecta Invertebrates and  4346 invertibrates excluding Insecta.

The present state of the Uttarakhand conforms to its rich heritage status supported by a rich floral diversity, vegetation, forest cover, healthy and pristine ecosystem and tremendous conservation efforts from species level to genetic level and to ecosystem level. Due to its unique bio-diversity, the state is also home to several rare and endangered species of herbal and aromatic plants. Realizing the immense potential of this resource in the state, the state government has declared Uttarakhand as a Herbal State.
